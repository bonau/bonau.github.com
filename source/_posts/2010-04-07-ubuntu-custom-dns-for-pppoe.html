<p>I've found that whenever I dial up PPPoE<br />
the /etc/resolv.conf will be rewritten<br />
so that name server is always set as ISP's default DNS.<br />
However, it's affected by the configuration of PPPoE.<br />
Now we'll try to solve this.</p>

<p><pre>
$ sudoedit /etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider
</pre>
find:
<pre>
usepeerdns
</pre>
change it to:
<pre>
#usepeerdns
</pre></p>

<p>Then feel free to edit /etc/resolv.conf.<br />
PPPoE will not overwrite your settings anymore.</p>
