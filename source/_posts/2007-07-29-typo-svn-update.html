<p><p>If you update Typo with Subversion and get the error message below:</p></p>

<p><pre><code>svn: Working copy 'tmp/cache' is missing or not locked
</code></pre></p>

<p><p>The way to solve it looks a little bit silly:</p></p>

<p><pre><code>rm -rf tmp/cache/; svn up
</code></pre></p>

<p><p>Nevertheless,<br />
I find out that I only have to remove tmp/cache/ once.<br />
And it makes everything back to the right track.<br />
I make another checkout<br />
in order to check if the problem occurs on every case,<br />
but it does not happen.</p></p>

<p><p>I have no idea how this situation will happen again.<br />
However, the solution is not so tricky, huh?</p></p>
