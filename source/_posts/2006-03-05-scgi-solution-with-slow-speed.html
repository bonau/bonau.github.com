<p><pre>Q:  It's really slow when I start it up and seems to leak memory.</pre></p>

<p><p>A:  You’re running it in development mode.  You most likely configured<br />
your processor with “-e development” so all you need to do is:</p></p>

<p><blockquote>scgi_ctrl config -M -e development<br />
scgi_ctrl restart</blockquote></p>

<p><p>This “merges” (-M) your previous configuration with the new config<br />
of “-e development” and then restarts your processor.</p></p>

<p><p>XD</p></p>
